# NaviGo - Mobile Navigation App Mockup

This repository contains a mockup of NaviGo, a mobile navigation application, created as part of a presentation at AICamp on AI Assisted Coding Workflows (Tuesday, July 29, 2025).

## Project Overview

NaviGo is a modern mobile navigation application mockup built with:
- Next.js
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Shadcn/ui Components

The project demonstrates best practices in modern web development and showcases how AI-assisted coding can enhance the development workflow.
